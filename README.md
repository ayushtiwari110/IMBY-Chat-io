## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushtiwari110/IMBY-Chat-io.git
   cd IMBY-Chat-io
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Alternatively you can do:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
   which installs the packages from the lock file.

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_secret

   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url

   NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_app_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster
   PUSHER_APP_ID=your_pusher_app_id
   PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret
   PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_app_key
   PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster

   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_url

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

3. Replace `your_*` with your actual API keys and endpoints
4. You will have to separately configure convex and clerk for proper integration. Refer to their quick-start guides for the same.

## Usage

To run the development server, open two terminals and run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```
```bash
npx convex dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture, leveraging various cloud services:

- Next.js handles server-side rendering and few API routes
- Convex manages real-time data synchronization and backend API Functions
- Clerk provides user authentication and session management
- Pusher enables real-time messaging and typing indicators
- LiveKit facilitates video calls
- Supabase stores and serves user-uploaded files
- Google's Gemini API powers the AI chat assistance

For a detailed system design, please refer to the [System Design Document](./SYSTEM_DESIGN.md).

## API Documentation

The application uses several external APIs and services. Here's a brief overview:

- [Clerk API](https://clerk.com/docs): Used for user authentication
- [Convex API](https://docs.convex.dev/): Handles data persistence and real-time updates
- [Pusher API](https://pusher.com/docs): Manages real-time events
- [LiveKit API](https://docs.livekit.io/): Facilitates video calls
- [Supabase API](https://supabase.com/docs): Handles file storage
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs): Provides AI-powered responses

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own instance:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your Vercel account to your GitHub account
3. Import the project into Vercel
4. Configure the environment variables in Vercel's dashboard
5. Deploy!
